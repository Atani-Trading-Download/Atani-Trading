## What is Atani Trading?

Atani represents a comprehensive cryptocurrency trading ecosystem that seamlessly integrates with numerous major exchanges through secure API connections, while offering powerful unified portfolio tracking and automated tax documentation features. The sophisticated platform consolidates all trading activity across connected exchanges into a single dashboard, providing users with complete visibility of their digital asset holdings, transaction history, and performance metrics across all their trading accounts.  

What distinguishes Atani from competitors is its intelligent built-in tax computation system that dynamically generates accurate, regulation-compliant tax reports for various international jurisdictions. Traders benefit from detailed portfolio visualization tools, real-time performance analytics, and the ability to execute trades simultaneously across multiple exchanges - all within Atani's streamlined interface. The platform effectively eliminates the need to constantly switch between different exchange dashboards.  

Atani's professional-grade trading terminal comes equipped with advanced charting functionality featuring dozens of technical indicators, extensive drawing tools, and customizable timeframes. The interface supports all major order types including limit, market, stop-loss, and trailing stop orders, with the added convenience of creating personalized trading templates for frequently traded pairs. Seasoned traders particularly value the multi-exchange arbitrage possibilities that the platform reveals through its innovative unified order book display, which highlights price discrepancies across connected exchanges.  

Security remains a paramount focus, with the platform employing read-only API keys as default configuration, while providing optional trading permissions. Atani maintains a non-custodial approach, meaning user funds always remain securely on the connected exchanges - the platform only interacts through encrypted API channels. Available as both a feature-rich desktop application and fully-functional mobile app, Atani ensures traders have constant access to their complete cross-exchange trading environment from any device, at any time.
